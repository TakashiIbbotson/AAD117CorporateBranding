# AAD117CorporateBranding

Uncommon Knowledge is a series of books, web courses and classes designed by Christopher Murphy in order to teach young people, primarily young adults the fundamentals of design and brand image.  The design must very much so reflect the client's personality however it must also get across the point of Uncommon Knowledge.  It should be fun and exciting but not unprofessional.

Things that Chris likes;
* Flat Design
* Tools
* Vibrant Colours
* Series of Books with consistency

I began to sketch some quick ideas.  The initial ideas that came to me  mostly revolved around brains and speech bubbles.  The idea to combine the brain and the speech bubble was to signify the fact that Chris would be talking knowledgably and represents the talks and classes he would speak at.

Another idea was to show Chris as the classic piece 'The Vetruvian Man' by Da Vinci.  The sketch showed Chris holding different things in his hands that represented him such as coffeee, swearwords, an Iphone and a brain.  Another idea showed a lightbulb with the letters 'FSCK' which mean 'file system consistency check'.  This is a tool for checking the consistency of a file system in Unix and Unix-like operating systems, such as Linux and Mac OS X.  It's also something that Chris has a lot of interest in as he has the letters tattooed onto his arm.  

On my one on one meeting with Chris I tried to think of some questions to ask him.  I created a word document containing some of the ideas I had sketched with some visual representations of images from the Internet.  I asked him a few questions;

**Would you prefer a dark of light colour scheme?**

Definitely lighter


**Do you want a lot of focus on swearing?**

No, I don't want to make it overpowering.


**Do you like the concept of brains?**

No, I find that brains are almost sickening.  They sort of seem like they would put you off food.



Moving on from the ideas of brains we started to discuss Neuroimaging.  I had an idea to create a series of books designed around Neuroimaging.  My plan was to have a short series of books with a head on each.  Each head would have a different area of the brain lit up.  Chris liked this idea and he said it reminded him of the old fashioned sketches of heads with each different area of the brain labelled.  We began to researched and discovered this was called Phrenology and decided I could create a series of books based around Phrenology using the same concept as the Neuroimaging idea.  

After my meeting with Chris I began to sketch a further idea for the books.  I researched Phrenology and found lots of different images relating to it.  I created a variety of book designs based around the Phrenology idea.  I used basic shapes and colour to create an interesting approach.
